 @article{2011, title={On Using
Twitter to Monitor Political Sentiment and Predict Election Results},
abstractNote={The body of content available on Twit- ter undoubtedly
contains a diverse range of political insight and commentary. But, to
what extent is this representative of an electorate? Can we model
political sentiment effectively enough to capture the voting intentions
of a nation during an election capaign? We use the recent Irish General
Election as a case study for investigating the potential to model
political sentiment through mining of social media. Our approach
combines sentiment analysis using supervised learning and volume-based
measures. We evaluate against the conventional election polls and the
final election result. We find that social analytics using both
volume-based measures and sentiment analysis are predictive and we make
a number of observations related to the task of monitoring public
sentiment during an election campaign, including examining a variety of
sample sizes, time periods as well as methods for qualitatively
exploring the underlying content.}, journal={Psychology},

DOI={10.1016/j.swevo.2011.02.002}, abstractNote={The interest in
nonparametric statistical analysis has grown recently in the field of
computational intelligence. In many experimental studies, the lack of
the required properties for a proper application of parametric
procedures - independence, normality, and homoscedasticity - yields to
nonparametric ones the task of performing a rigorous comparison among
algorithms. In this paper, we will discuss the basics and give a survey
of a complete set of nonparametric procedures developed to perform both
pairwise and multiple comparisons, for multi-problem analysis. The test
problems of the CEC'2005 special session on real parameter optimization
will help to illustrate the use of the tests throughout this tutorial,
analyzing the results of a set of well-known evolutionary and swarm
intelligence algorithms. This tutorial is concluded with a compilation
of considerations and recommendations, which will guide practitioners
when using these tests to contrast their experimental results. © 2011

DOI={10.1016/j.eswa.2013.01.001}, abstractNote={The emergence of Web
2.0 has drastically altered the way users perceive the Internet, by
improving information sharing, collaboration and interoperability.
Micro-blogging is one of the most popular Web 2.0 applications and
related services, like Twitter, have evolved into a practical means for
sharing opinions on almost all aspects of everyday life. Consequently,
micro-blogging web sites have since become rich data sources for opinion
mining and sentiment analysis. Towards this direction, text-based
sentiment classifiers often prove inefficient, since tweets typically do
not consist of representative and syntactically consistent words, due to
the imposed character limit. This paper proposes the deployment of
original ontology-based techniques towards a more efficient sentiment
analysis of Twitter posts. The novelty of the proposed approach is that
posts are not simply characterized by a sentiment score, as is the case
with machine learning-based classifiers, but instead receive a sentiment
grade for each distinct notion in the post. Overall, our proposed
architecture results in a more detailed analysis of post opinions
regarding a specific topic. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

DOI={10.1016/j.dss.2012.12.022}, abstractNote={Social broadcasting
networks such as Twitter in the U.S. and ``Weibo'' in China are
transforming the way online word of mouth (WOM) is disseminated and
consumed in the digital age. In the present study, we investigated
whether and how Twitter WOM affects movie sales by estimating a dynamic
panel data model using publicly available data and well-known machine
learning algorithms. We found that chatter on Twitter does matter;
however, the magnitude and direction of the effect depend on whom the
WOM is from and what the WOM is about. Incorporating the number of
followers the author of each WOM message had into our study, we found
that the effect of WOM from users followed by more Twitter users is
significantly larger than those followed by less Twitter users. In
support of some recent findings about the importance of WOM valence on
product sales, we also found that positive Twitter WOM is associated
with higher movie sales, whereas negative WOM is associated with lower
movie sales. Interestingly, we found that the strongest effect on movie
sales comes from those tweets in which the authors expressed their
intention to watch a certain movie. We attribute this finding to the
dual effects of such intention tweets on movie sales: the direct effect
through the WOM author's own purchase behavior, and the indirect effect
through either the awareness effect or the persuasive effect of the WOM
on its recipients. Our findings provide new perspectives to understand
the effect of WOM on product sales and have important managerial
implications. For example, our study reveals the potential values of
monitoring people's intentions and sentiments on Twitter and identifying
influential users for companies wishing to harness the power of social
broadcasting networks. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.}, number={4},

messages on a variety of topics every day. This study uses the context
of the German federal election to investigate whether Twitter is used as
a forum for political deliberation and whether online messages on
Twitter validly mirror offline political sentiment. Using LIWC text
analysis software, we conducted a content analysis of over 100,000
messages containing a reference to either a political party or a
politician. Our results show that Twitter is indeed used extensively for
political deliberation. We find that the mere number of messages
mentioning a party reflects the election result. Moreover, joint
mentions of two parties are in line with real world political ties and
coalitions. An analysis of the tweets' political sentiment demonstrates
close correspondence to the parties' and politicians' political
positions indicating that the content of Twitter messages plausibly
reflects the offline political landscape. We discuss the use of
microblogging message content as a valid indicator of political
sentiment and derive suggestions for further research.},

@article{2002b, title={Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down? Semantic Orientation
Applied to Unsupervised Classification of Reviews},
url={http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P02-1053.pdf},
abstractNote={This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning
algorithm for classifying reviews as recommended (thumbs up) or not
rec-ommended (thumbs down). The classifi-cation of a review is predicted
by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that
contain adjec-tives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive semantic
orientation when it has good as-sociations (e.g., `` subtle nuances '')
and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g.,
`` very cavalier ''). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a
phrase is calculated as the mutual infor-mation between the given phrase
and the word `` excellent '' minus the mutual information between the
given phrase and the word `` poor '' . A review is classified as
recommended if the average semantic ori-entation of its phrases is
positive. The al-gorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74\% when
evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different
domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel
destinations). The ac-curacy ranges from 84\% for automobile reviews to
66\% for movie reviews.}, author={Turney, Peter D}, year={2002}}
